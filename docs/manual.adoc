== Introduction

== User Interface

=== Operators

At the left side, there is a list of operators that generate the sound.
New operators can be added using the "Add Operator" menu.

Each operator has a name, which must be unique. To change the name of an
operator, double-click on the title. Operators can be folded with the
triangle button at the left upper corner, to save screen space. The x at
the upper right side deletes the operator.

Operators can be moved upwards and downwards by clicking on the title and
dragging the operator. The color of the title indicates the status of the
operator:

* green: this operator is selected as output
* white: the operator is part of the output sound
* grey: the operator is not used (not part of the output sound)

The output operator at the right side contains global settings which
control how the sound output is performed. There is always one output
operator.

=== Instrument List

In order to store user defined instruments, SpectMorph has a global list
of 128 instruments. Each slot can contain one user defined instrument.

The instrument number can be set from the WavSource operator. It is important
that you use an empty position for each new instrument.  Suppose you assigned
number 7 for an intrument based on a vocal sample.  Whenever you use
SpectMorph, slot number 7 will contain this instrument. As long as you are
experimenting with a new instrument, you can change it in any way you like.
However, as soon as you start using the instrument in a song, you
should never change it again.

=== Samples

An instrument is created based on one or more samples. For simple use cases,
one sample is enough. However, if you play a sample with much higher frequency
or lower frequency than the original recording, it will no longer sound
natural. If this happens, you need to add more samples. For some instruments,
two samples per octave could be enough, for others, you need 3 or 4 samples per
octave to get a good quality. Many standard instruments that ship with
SpectMorph even use 12 samples per octave.

During playback, SpectMorph will pick the closest sample to the midi note it
needs to play.

=== Loop Modes

For each sample, you need to define a loop. The loop markers are blue and
have click/drag handles at the top of the window. Since your sample ends
after some time, a loop is required to handle notes that are longer than
this time.

==== Single Frame

A single frame loop will freeze the sound once it enters the loop. It does
this by playing the same analysis frame again and again. This is good for
sounds that don't change over time, like for instance organ sounds.

For sounds that change over time, like sounds with vibrato/tremolo, this
loop mode is not useful.

==== Forward

A forward loop will play from left to right loop marker and then jump back
to left. Since the forward loop jumps back, this will only sound good if
the sample sounds very similar at the left and right loop point.

Note that to define a loop, you donâ€˜t have to find the exactly right time
points. The SpectMorph analysis/synthesis method only needs loop points that
are approximately correct. This is different from samplers, that replay the
sample data directly, where the loop points must be at the exactly perfect
position to avoid clicks.

==== Ping Pong

A ping pong loop will play from left to right loop marker, then reverse
play back to left, play to right, back to left...

The advantage of a ping pong loop is that there are no jumps, which means
that no matter how the sample sounds at the left/right marker, it will
always sound good.

As an example how to use ping pong loops: if you have recorded some
instrument with vibrato, you select half a period of the vibrato:

* set the left loop marker the point where the vibrato is down
* set the right loop marker to the next point where the vibrato is up

=== Midi Note (Pitch)

For each sample, you need to assign the correct pitch. SpectMorph needs to know
which pitch your sample has to transpose it correctly up and down during
synthesis. If you click on "Edit" next to "Midi Note", a dialog will show up.
This dialog has been designed to find the correct midi note in case you don't
know it already.

Using "Space" you can toggle playback of the selected sample. If you left click
on one of the notes, you can hear the pitch of a reference instrument. By
trying to click on some of the notes while your selected sample is played
you can find the correct pitch. Once you are certain what the pitch should
be, double-click and close the dialog.
