==NAME==
smstrip - program to remove extra data from SpectMorph model files

==SYNOPSIS==
'''smstrip''' ''SM-File...''

== DESCRIPTION ==

'''smstrip''' is a tool which removes all debugging data from a SpectMorph model.
By default, smenc includes more data than is required for playback in the SM-File.
This extra data can be removed, thereby shrinking the file size considerably.
Note that stripped models can be created directly by the encoder using '''smenc -s'''.

== OPTIONS ==

'''smstrip''' follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('-').

; '''-h''', '''--help'''
: Shows a brief help message.

; '''-v''', '''--version'''
: Prints out '''smstrip''' version.

; '''--keep-samples'''
: Strips  debugging information, but keeps the original sample data (useful for quality comparisions). This of course reduces the file size less than full stripping.
