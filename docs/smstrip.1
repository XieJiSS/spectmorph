NAME


.PP
smstrip \- program to remove extra data from SpectMorph model files
.SH
SYNOPSIS


.PP
\fBsmstrip\fP \fISM\-File...\fP
.SH
DESCRIPTION


.PP
\fBsmstrip\fP is a tool which removes all debugging data from a SpectMorph model.
By default, smenc includes more data than is required for playback in the SM\-File.
This extra data can be removed, thereby shrinking the file size considerably. Note
that stripped models can be created directly by the encoder using \fBsmenc \-s\fP.
.SH
OPTIONS

Strips debugging information, but keeps the original sample data (useful for quality
comparisions). This of course reduces the file size less than full stripping.
