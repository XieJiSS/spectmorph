DESCRIPTION


.PP
\fBsmstrip\fP is a tool which removes all debugging data from a SpectMorph model.
By default, smenc includes more data than is required for playback in the SM-File.
This extra data can be removed, thereby shrinking the file size considerably. Note
that stripped models can be created directly by the encoder using \fBsmenc -s\fP.
