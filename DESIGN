FileFormat Design:

Spectmorph File:
* multiple "named" instruments
* should be compressable with xz
* should be relocatable (if samples are referred to and not included)

Instrument:
* multiple samples for
  - multiple midi notes
  - multiple velocity layers

Samples:
* multiple frames
  -> noise component
  -> deterministic component
* loop start, loop end, ping pong stuff


TODO:
* articulation (staccato vs. true legato)
