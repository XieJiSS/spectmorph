general:
 - preserve scroll position on fold/...
 - recover after loading junk
 - add output if necessary (morph_plan->ensure_output())
 - scroll wheel propagation
 - post resize and signal_update possibly occur in wrong order

beast:
 - init with default plan

windows:
 - 32bit compile crashes in apply window sse code - why?
 - zoom doesn't resize windows in cubase
 - keyboard input broken
 - dpi scaling
 - led sometimes wrong

later:
 - popup menu
 - knob
