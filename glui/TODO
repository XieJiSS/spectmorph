general:
 - post resize and signal_update possibly occur in wrong order
 - avoid unnecessary grid morph updates

other:
 - tuba, double bass, ...
 - improve sminstbuilder tools to support relative filenames
 - morph plan operator cycles lead to crashes
 - font (?)

later:
 - 32bit compile crashes in apply window sse code - why?
 - popup menu
 - knob
