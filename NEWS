Overview of Changes in spectmorph-0.0.2:

* bugfixes
* include proper phases, so phase-correct reconstruction of samples is possible
* new programs:
  - smstrip     - removes debugging information from SpectMorph model files
  - smextract   - extracts data from SpectMorph models, for developers only for now
* added --no-noise / --no-sines switches for smplay
* added -s switch for smenc, to create stripped models
* use boost numeric bindings + lapack for ideal phase/magnitude estimation (smenc -O2) - slow!
* SSE optimizations and other speedups for fast phase/magnitude estimation (smenc -O1)
* use odd/centered FFT to be able to reconstruct phases from FFT data  (smenc -O0)
* use different thresholding scheme for encoder, detecting more partials
* document API with doxygen
* move Encoder and other classes to libspectmorph
* added python binding, capable of reading SpectMorph model files
* added automated tests
* added manual pages for smenc, smplay, smvisualize and smstrip
* added overview document in docs directory

Overview of Changes in spectmorph-0.0.1:

* initial public release with three programs
  - smenc       - builds model of a sample
  - smplay      - resynthesizes sample from model
  - smvisualize - visualizes model
