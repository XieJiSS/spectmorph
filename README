SpectMorph
==========

SpectMorph can build a model of a sample. This model can then be
used to create new samples

Building a model
================

Assuming that you have a wave file of a piano called piano.wav

$ smenc piano.wav piano.sm

will build a model from the sample

Resynthesis from a model
========================

$ smplay piano.sm

will play the model

Visualizing a model
===================

$ smvisualize piano.sm piano.png db

will produce a png in which the original fft analysis data (black/white)
will be drawn, as well as the partials used by the model (red)
