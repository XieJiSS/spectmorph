1) re-encode

- SpectMorph file format and/or encoding algorithm changed
- given samples and additional markers/loop points
=> generate updated smset

2) loop design

- unlooped or badly looped instrument input
- reset loop points at gui
=> generate updated smset

3) encoder test

- given original signal and encoded signal
- inspect accuracy of spectrum
- listen to original and encoded samples

4) morphing test

- given two smsets
- inspect spectrum
- inspect assignment between partials

5) time alignment

- given smset
- set time alignment markers for attack
