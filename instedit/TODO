- creator should thread::join()
- avoid raw WavData pointer for WavSetBuilder (could be deleted) => shared pointer or similar
- temp file handling
- don't allow play if changes are to be made
- fix error handling for WavSet::save() and others

UI:
- fix file dialog mask (allow .wav, .flac, ...)
- fix file dialog in ardour
- tuning and volume
- plot tuning line
- encoder parameters
- better progress bar widget
- combobox should support scroll wheel
- allow removing sample from instrument
- maybe upsample or interpolate waveform

BUGS:
- debug why lv2 ui sometimes starts without plan

SVEN:
- display total sample time

STORAGE:
- smjack should keep instrument in memory after load / edit
- load/edit should actually show the instrument
- morph plan attachments
- lv2 plugin should use instance access
- store-as-zip with preset
- sminstedit load / store instrument should work
