  - move common init code from smenc to encoder parameters
  - move clipping down into the encoder (do not clip on cache hit)
- fix mirko-ah somehow (clip once)

- avoid printf in messaging
- temp file handling
- auto tune and stuff

- frozen flac in memory

- fix file dialog mask (allow .wav, .flac, ...)
- fix file dialog in ardour
- fix error handling for WavSet::save() and others
- debug why lv2 ui sometimes starts without plan
