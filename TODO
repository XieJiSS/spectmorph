NEXT RELEASE:
- homepage updates
  * documentation
  * move old docs
  * Morphing Motion upload
  * contact (+ google group)
- evaluation 8
- add template with unison
- final steps:
  - build tgz
  - build debs
  - build instrument tgz

NEXT NEXT RELEASE:
- screencast
- maybe subharmonic tagging
- maybe lv2 dirty
- why does white noise not sound like white noise?

smenc:
- move partial pruning step to seperate step to be performed after attack optimization
- merge new-pruning-scaling branch somehow
- implement phase-correct "nearest frame" decoding instead of overlap-adding frames
- compute peak over nearest minimum in dB
- compute peak over local (frame) maximum in dB
- debug performance problems
  => implement downsampling for really low notes
  => use symmetry to speed up optimize_partials
  => make a squared window table (optimize_partials)
- implement sinc interpolation for spectrum phase
- make load() function of SpectMorph::Audio and SpectMorph::WavSet reset state
- optimize memory usage of encoder
- reanalyze residual after first pass
- increase time resolution for residual for low notes
- use NoiseBandPartition class to get faster noise band splitting
- adjust noise bands according to frequency specs

smlive:
- make FFTW integration thread safe
- maybe use integer phase representation (-> less floor()/float->int/int->float cycles)
- SSEified noise generation:
  * use a table of (sin[0] cos[0], .. sin[255] cos[255])
  * load sincos[random] sincos[random+1] and shuffle values together
  * write out result
  * combine loop with apply window
- SSEify render_partial

lag diagrams of note start

documentation:
- update API documentation with new classes (LiveDecoder, GenericIn*)

sminspector:
- figure out why mix_freq is 0 for inspect1 foo.wav

gui:
- die if parent process dies
- object level file versioning
- support unsetting operators

morphing:
- performance: use O(n) loop to associate each freq with the nearest freq of the
  other input -> less search cycles, since we already have the best match freq

lv2:
- use worker thread response for setting|freeing morph plans
